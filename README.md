# WWWKD

## Introduction

This repository contains the WWWKD website, as a kirby structure (in the form of a folder).

## Installation

To work on this website you will need:
- your code editor
- a GitHub account
- GitHub Desktop
- an invitation to contribute on the repository from the owner: @ninjvninjv (Nina)

### Install Github Desktop

Here is the link to install: https://desktop.github.com/
Once installed, you will need to sign in with your existing GitHub account. 

To summarize, the repository is kind of like a folder on dropbox: it's in one place, we all have a copy on our laptop, when changes are made they can be uploaded directly to the common copy.
But, the difference is: with the repository, you make an actual copy on your computer and the actual repo is on GitHub. So you can change your local copy as much as you want, it won't change what's in other people's copies. If you want to add your changes to the main folder and files, you will have to 'push' your 'commits' (changes) towards the original copy. The great thing is, Github saves a history of all the 'commits', which means if a mistake is made or we override each other's work, we can always go back!

Ok, so now we can install your copy of the repository, so you can start making local changes.
